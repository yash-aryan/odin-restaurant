# odin-restaurant

This is a practice project I did while doing The Odin Project Course.

- It features a Lo-Fi dynamically created website through index.js & modules for each page in the /src directory.
- All of the javascript & css files are bundled together into main.js using Webpack in the /dist directory.
- Used npm for installing & working with dependencies like css loader & webpack.
